# Sling: Low-Code CMS for Developers

Welcome to **Sling**, a low-code drag-and-drop CMS platform designed to empower developers with full control over the frontend and backend. Whether you're looking to quickly build dynamic pages, customize widgets, or manage your content efficiently, Sling provides a scalable, developer-friendly solution.

Sling is split into three primary modules:
- **API**: Manages all backend logic, database connections, and API calls.
- **Frontend (sling-fe)**: The frontend for managing routes, templates, and drag-and-drop widgets.
- **Studio**: The admin interface where users can create, edit, and customize their content visually.

## Features

- **Low-Code Drag-and-Drop**: Create marketing pages, blogs, and dynamic websites with our intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
- **Customizable Widgets**: Build and integrate your own widgets using JSON and seamlessly add them to your pages.
- **Real-Time Previews**: See the changes you make instantly with live editing and page previews.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Backend built on Node.js and MongoDB, allowing you to scale your projects easily.
- **Developer-Focused**: Built with developers in mind, providing full control over frontend and backend customization.
